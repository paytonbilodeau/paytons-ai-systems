## Warnings and review

- Container and stream metadata are not preserved; the encoder may add new technical tags.
- All timestamps refer to the original source.
- Review every spoken-marker cut and every long cut before replacing a manual edit.
- Keep the source file until the new output passes the review checklist.

The source SHA-256 was identical before and after the smoke render. This example validates the maintained macOS test fixture, not an individual buyer's computer or footage.
